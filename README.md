Genetic Algorithm code from Kei Codes Tutorial (https://github.com/kiecodes/genetic-algorithms/tree/master) 

with comments from my understanding of how it works

A genetic algorithm is a computer technique inspired by natural selection, where a population of possible solutions to a problem is created and each is evaluated using a fitness function to see how good it is; then, the best solutions are selected and combined using crossover (mixing), sometimes changed slightly by mutation, and these new solutions replace worse ones in the population. This evolutionary process repeats over many generations, steadily improving the population’s quality, and the algorithm stops when a good solution is found or after a set number of generations; although genetic algorithms find strong solutions to hard problems quickly, they don’t always guarantee the absolute best answer.
